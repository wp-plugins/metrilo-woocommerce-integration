== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it slow down my site? =

Absolutely no. Metrilo's tracking library loads async and doesn't slow down your website at all.

= How long should I wait before I have enough data to trust and act on? =

It really depends on how many visitors do you have per day. It's a good idea to wait at least a week.
